# Decision-Analytics
MSDS 460 Decision Analytics Course 
Professor Thomas W. Miller

## Course Description
This course covers fundamental concepts, solution techniques, modeling
approaches, and applications of decision analytics. It introduces commonly used
methods of optimization, simulation, and decision analysis techniques for
prescriptive analytics in business. Students explore linear programming, network
optimization, integer linear programming, goal programming, multiple objective
optimizations, nonlinear programming, metaheuristic algorithms, stochastic
simulation, queuing modeling, decision analysis, and Markov decision processes.
Students develop a contextual understanding of techniques useful for managerial
decision support. They implement decision-analytic techniques using state-of-the-
art analytical modeling platforms. This is a problem and project-based course.

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
-  Demonstrate skills and techniques in optimization, simulation, and decision analysis
-  Select and recommend appropriate modeling techniques given a business problem
-  Formulate and develop decision analytic solutions to business problems
-  Present the results of decision analytic solutions in oral and written forms
