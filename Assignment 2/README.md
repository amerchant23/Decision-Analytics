## Developed by:
**Thomas W. Miller**  
**Revised September 17, 2024**

## Overview
This project proposal outlines the development of a consumer-focused recommendation system for over one hundred restaurants in Marlborough, Massachusetts. The system will utilize Yelp reviews as its primary data source and will be designed to help restaurant owners enhance their business through informed recommendations. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for project setup, model specification, programming, solution analysis, and an overview intended for prospective clients.

## Project Scope
- **Project Goal**: Develop a recommendation system using Yelp reviews to provide insights for restaurant owners in Marlborough, MA.
- **Technology Stack**:
  - Frontend: Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS
  - Backend: Go web server with a GraphQL API
  - Data Science: Python, Go, or R for analytics
  - Database: PostgreSQL, EdgeDB, or PocketBase
- **Hosting**: Major cloud platforms (AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform)

## Deliverables
The project consists of five main parts, each contributing to a holistic understanding of the project plan:

1. **Problem Setup**:
   - An updated Excel spreadsheet containing tasks, completion times, per-hour costs, and responsible personnel.
   - Areas of uncertainty regarding project components, time, or cost estimates.
   - A directed graph diagram illustrating task dependencies.

2. **Model Specification**:
   - A linear programming model that specifies the time and cost estimates.
   - An objective function that assumes equal hourly rates for all contributors.

3. **Programming**:
   - Implementation of the linear programming problem using Python PuLP or AMPL.
   - Program code and output provided as text files within the GitHub repository.

4. **Solution**:
   - Analysis of best-case, expected, and worst-case scenarios for project completion.
   - Identification of the critical path for each scenario.
   - Gantt charts illustrating the timeline for each solution.

5. **Overview**:
   - A summary of the project for prospective clients, including pricing and expected delivery timelines.
   - Consideration of the impact of additional contractors on project delivery.
