The Diet Problem Revisited (Version 11)

**Developed by:** Thomas W. Miller  
**Revised:** September 17, 2024

## Overview

Introduced by Stigler (1945) and discussed by Dantzig (1990), the diet problem is a classic problem in constrained optimization often used to introduce linear programming concepts. The diet problem has been studied extensively through the years (van Dooren 2018).

## Purpose

This project aims to construct a personalized diet using current recommended dietary allowances from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, updated to account for recent research on sodium intake and health (Mente, O'Donnell, and Yusuf 2021).

## Nutritional Constraints

The constraints for this linear programming problem consider seven components of nutrition and their daily values, as shown in the following table:

| Component   | Max/Min  | Daily Amount and Measure         |
|-------------|----------|----------------------------------|
| Sodium      | Maximum  | 5,000 milligrams (mg)           |
| Energy      | Minimum  | 2,000 Calories (kilocalories, kcal) |
| Protein     | Minimum  | 50 grams (g)                    |
| Vitamin D   | Minimum  | 20 micrograms (Âµg)              |
| Calcium   | Minimum  | 1,300 milligrams (mg)              |
| Iron   | Minimum  | 18 milligrams (mg)           |
| Potassium   | Minimum  | 4,700 milligrams (mg)              |
